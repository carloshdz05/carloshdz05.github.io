## CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1, was a fundamental lab to me and also one of my favorites. It was our first taste of how computer science would be for us, and though it was hard to understand at first, looking back, it was an easy lab. Lab 1 is a great lab to look back at because it shows your progress and reminds you how it felt initially to tackle computer science. 

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1, was a lab I still remember because of how fun I found it. In this lab, we made our own Mad Lib with our partner by inserting nouns and verbs. Then, it was still a little confusing, but when we got the code to work, it was cool to see it run and print out our own Mad Lib. It was the first time I remember being wowed with our work in our labs. 

* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1, was a lab that always stuck out to me because that lab was the first lab that gave me trouble in computer science. We were supposed to write code that would calculate a man's or woman's BMR based on calculations with their height, weight, and age. This lab was my first experience where my partner and I were lost and needed help. This required me to go to SI sessions and try to get help outside of class to figure out how to write the code. Looking back, it was a pretty good assignment, and we just had to learn how to code the calculations. Because of my experience with this lab, it is one I think back on and enjoy a lot.
